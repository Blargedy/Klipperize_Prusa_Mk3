# Klipperize Prusa Mk3
This repo is for sharing the results of my efforts to upgrade the performance of my Prusa Mk3s. It is not a project aimed at mass adoption and therfore does not include modularity for individual variations in component selection.

That being said, I designed the printer to use the [Rapid Burner](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/V0/Rapid_Burner) by [chirpy2605 aka waytotheweb](https://github.com/chirpy2605), which is designed to work with the Voron v0.2. This means that my mods will work with any design that is compatible with the Voron v0.2 tool mount. Chirpy has a wide array of options for hotends, fans, extruders, and LEDs, so by Chirpy's efforts my mod can accomodate most people's hardware choices. 

***This project is still a work-in-progress, so expect files to change until I am satisfied with the result.***
